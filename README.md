# Usage
First, we have to create a user and register a password for it. Each tiime we want to acces to the app we will have to register our user information this will ensure us that the information will be only visible for the respectivy user. Then we will see all activities that we have registered in the past, the one that are still pending will be shown with background color red. At anytime we can add a new activity/task/chores that we will like to get track about. 

Once we have finish the task we can change its status to completed. Depending on the user he has the option to Delete all the activities that are not need anymore to do track.

# Roadmap
Sorting the activities by the completed status is still on work. 

# Project Status
